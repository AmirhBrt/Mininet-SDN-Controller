# Mininet-SDN-Controller

This project utilizes the Mininet environment to analyze a network and find the minimum delay between two nodes. It provides a Python program that creates a custom network topology using Mininet, calculates the minimum delay between specified nodes.

## Introduction

In computer networking, it is crucial to understand the performance characteristics of a network, such as latency and delay, to ensure efficient data transmission. Mininet is a network emulator that allows the creation of virtual networks using software-defined networking (SDN) principles. SDN separates the control plane from the data plane, enabling centralized network management and programmability.

## SDN for Routers

SDN can be particularly useful for routers in several ways:

1. **Centralized Control**: In traditional router architectures, control functions are distributed across multiple devices, making it challenging to manage and configure the network. SDN provides a centralized controller that allows network administrators to have a holistic view of the network and manage it from a single point.

2. **Dynamic Routing**: SDN enables dynamic routing by allowing the controller to make routing decisions based on real-time network conditions. This flexibility allows routers to adapt to changing network conditions, optimize traffic flow, and improve overall network performance.

3. **Traffic Engineering**: SDN allows for fine-grained control over traffic engineering and quality of service (QoS) policies. Routers can prioritize certain types of traffic, allocate bandwidth dynamically, and enforce traffic policies based on application requirements.

4. **Programmability**: SDN provides an open and programmable interface, such as OpenFlow, that allows network administrators to customize the behavior of routers and implement new features or protocols. This programmability enhances the flexibility and extensibility of the router infrastructure.

By leveraging SDN principles, routers can become more intelligent, adaptable, and efficient in managing network traffic and providing better overall network performance.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Install Mininet on your system. Refer to the Mininet documentation for installation instructions.

2. Run the Python program `mininet_network_analysis.py`.

3. The program will create a custom network topology using Mininet, calculate the minimum delay between specified nodes, and print the result.

4. You can modify the custom topology, specified nodes, or other parameters in the Python program to suit your requirements.

## Conclusion

The Mininet Network Analysis project demonstrates how SDN, implemented through the Mininet environment, can be used to analyze network performance and find the minimum delay between nodes. By utilizing SDN principles, routers can become more efficient, adaptable, and programmable, leading to enhanced network performance and improved user experience.
